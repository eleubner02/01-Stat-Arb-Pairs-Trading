# 01-Stat-Arb-Pairs-Trading

# This project is designed to build a technical foundation for quant trading. It will be guided by three principles:

## —Affirming Core Competencies: data ingestion and cleaning (pandas), statistical analysis and modeling (statsmodels), vectorized backtesting (algorithmic thinking) and performance attribution (risk/return analysis)
## —Prioritzing Retention > Complexity: classic, well understood strategy (statistical arbitrage), to focus on high-quality implementation. Deep practical understanding of core tools and concepts
## —Building a Narrative: End Product (well-documented GitHub repository) is a communication tool designed to tell a clear story. Take a quantitative concept, translate it into functional code, analyze its performance, and communicate results professionally

# We will employ a Statistical Arbitrage (stat arb) pairs trading strategy. This method leverages a stationary spread between cointegrated series; for example, if Stock A and Stock B are cointegrated and Stock A rises, we may simultaneously short Stock A and buy Stock B. Thus, regardless of overall market trends, we profit when the spread returns to normal. Such a strategy is valuable because it requires us to:

## —Form a Hypothesis: "These two stocks are economically linked."
## —Test it Statistically: Use tools like statsmodels to find evidence for that link.
## —Generate a Signal: Develop a rule (e.g., "when the spread is 2 standard deviations from the mean") to identify a trading opportunity.
## —Execute a Market-Neutral Strategy: By shorting one and buying the other, we are largely insulated from the overall market's movement. We are isolating the specific relationship we modeled.
